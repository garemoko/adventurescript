Place: Tutorial Two - Make Some Changes
Welcome to the second tutorial. It's time for you to make your first edits. 
Use the 'Load Adventures' menu to download this tutorial. Use a text editor like Notepad or TextEdit to make some changes to the place title and description (this text). Then use the 'Upload' option on the 'Load Adventures' menu to reload the adventure. 
When you edit the Txtory file you'll see that it starts with "Place:". This tells Txtory that what follows describes a place within adventure. Take care not to delete or modify the "Place:" keyword or the place will not be loaded. You'll learn how to add additional places in the next tutorial. 
Once you're done editting and reloading the Txtory file, you can move on to Tutorial Three - Places.
